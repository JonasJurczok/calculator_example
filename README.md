# Calculator example

This repo is used for the `Coding as a foreign language` course to demonstrate `Test Driven Development` and `Pair Programming`

To run the tests execute `./setup.py test` in this directory.

To change the tests you can use any text editor of your choice. For example `Notepad`, `Notepad++` or
`PyCharm`.

## On windows

Download the project with the download link. Extract the zip archive to your Desktop.
You should have a folder named `calculator_example-master` now.

Open an explorer (windows + e) and navigate to your python installation. In the folder you
will find a file named `winpy terminal`. Double click it. This should give you a black
terminal window.

Now in the terminal navigate to the folder where you put the calculator_example.
To change a directory in the terminal you can type `cd <new folder>`. No navigate one folder
up (to the parent folder) use `cd ..`.

The left side of the terminal window shows you where you currently are.
If you followed the instructions above the example should be in `C:\Users\<your short username>\Desktop\calculator_example-master`.

After navigating to the folder type `python setup.py test` and hit enter to run the tests.
From now on you can press `arrow up` to get the last command and then hit enter to run it again.
